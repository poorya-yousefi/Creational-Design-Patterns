# Prototype Design Pattern

The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to create new objects by copying existing objects. This pattern is useful when you need to create many objects of the same type, and the creation process is *complex* or *expensive*.

## Best Use Cases

- When you need to create many objects of the same type.
- When the creation process is complex or expensive.
- When you need to clone existing objects with different configurations.
- When you need to create objects that are immutable or have complex relationships with other objects.

## Pros

- **Efficient object creation**: Once you have a prototype, you can create new objects quickly and easily by cloning it.
- **Flexible object creation**: You can create objects with different configurations by modifying the prototype before cloning it.
- **Decoupling the creation process from the client code**: The client code doesn't need to know how the objects are created, only that they can be cloned.

## Cons

- **Increased complexity**: The prototype pattern can add complexity to your code, especially if you have many different prototypes.
- **Potential for *shallow copies***: If you're not careful, cloning an object can result in a shallow copy, which means that the new object will share references to the same underlying data as the original object. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you modify the original object.
- **Limited flexibility**: The prototype pattern is less flexible than other creational patterns, such as the factory pattern, because it requires you to have a concrete prototype object.
